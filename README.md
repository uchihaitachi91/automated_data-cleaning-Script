Certainly! Here's a sample README.md file for a GitHub repository containing an Automated Data Cleaning Script:

# Automated Data Cleaning Script

## Introduction
This repository contains an automated data-cleaning script that helps streamline the process of cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis. The script is designed to handle common data-cleaning tasks such as missing value imputation, outlier detection, duplicate removal, and more.

## Features
- Automates data cleaning tasks to save time and effort
- Customizable to suit different datasets and cleaning requirements
- Supports various data formats such as CSV, Excel, and SQL databases
- Provides detailed logs and reports for transparency and reproducibility
- Easy to integrate into existing data pipelines or workflows

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-cleaning-script.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd data-cleaning-script
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Customize the script to fit your data cleaning needs by editing the configuration files.

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset in a supported format (CSV, Excel, SQL).
2. Update the input file path and cleaning configurations in the script.
3. Run the data cleaning script:
```bash
python data_cleaning_script.py
```
4. Review the generated logs and cleaned dataset for any further adjustments.

## Configuration
- `config.yaml`: Contains settings for data cleaning tasks such as missing value imputation, outlier detection, etc.
- `data_cleaning_script.py`: Main script file for automated data cleaning.
