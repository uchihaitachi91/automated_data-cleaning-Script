Sure, here's a sample README.md file for a Hand Written Digit Recognizer project on GitHub:

# Hand Written Digit Recognizer

## Introduction
This project is a hand written digit recognizer built using machine learning techniques. It is trained on the MNIST dataset and can accurately classify hand written digits from 0 to 9.

## Features
- Trained on the MNIST dataset of hand written digits
- Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for high accuracy
- Provides a simple web interface to upload and classify hand written digits
- Includes pre-trained model weights for quick deployment
- Open source and easy to extend

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digit-recognizer.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd digit-recognizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the pre-trained model weights from the releases page and place them in the `models/` directory.

## Usage
1. Start the web server:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`

3. Draw a digit in the canvas and click "Classify" to see the predicted digit.

## Training
To train the model from scratch:
1. Ensure you have the MNIST dataset downloaded and extracted.
2. Update the dataset path in `train.py`
3. Run the training script:
```bash
python train.py
```
4. The trained model weights will be saved in the `models/` directory.
